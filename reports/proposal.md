# Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our role**: Data Analytics Team in the House Sale team in Seattle King County.

**Target audience**: House Sale agents, Residents of Seattle and new incomers who want to purchase house in King County, Seattle.

Even though finding a suitable and safe living space is essential for everyone, it can be a challenging task that requires a lot of effort and time. There are numerous factors to consider when searching for a home, such as location, price, size, condition, and the neighborhood's safety and security.

We believe that if we can provide potential homeowners with accurate and reliable information on the housing market, they will be able to make better-informed decisions when purchasing or renting a property. With our house app, we aim to simplify the process of finding a home by displaying data on the housing market in a user-friendly way. By doing so, we hope to help our users save time and money and ultimately find their dream home.

Our app will allow users to search for homes based on various criteria such as price range, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and location. Additionally, we will display data on the average home prices, the average price per square foot, and the average rental rates for different neighborhoods. We will also incorporate a map feature that will show the locations of available homes and allow users to filter based on crime rates, school districts, and other relevant factors.


# Section 2: Description of Data

# Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios

Below is an example usage scenario.

A real estate agent who is looking for suitable properties for a client who is interested in buying a house in Seattle. The agent can use the dashboard to filter the available listings based on the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and price range. The agent can then view the filtered results on a map that shows the location of each property, along with its price and square footage information. The agent can also view the filtered results in a data table that shows the relevant information in a tabular format. Additionally, the agent can view a price histogram that shows the distribution of prices for the filtered listings, which can help in setting a reasonable price for the client's property. Overall, this app provides an efficient and effective way for real estate agents to search for suitable properties for their clients in Seattle.
