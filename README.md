## what is this app about

The app is a Seattle housing listings dashboard that provides users with the ability to filter and explore real estate data. The app allows users to filter data based on variables such as price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square footage. The filtered data is then displayed in a data table and on an interactive map that displays housing prices based on location. The app also includes a histogram of housing prices and allows users to interact with the data to gain insights about the Seattle housing market.

## How to use this app

The program follows a conventional dashboard layout in which the user can select or specify the scope of what they need to visualize on the left side, and a set of relevant visualization components that update in response to the user's selection criteria on the right.

Here's a link to the live [application](https://markusnam.shinyapps.io/VanCrime/) if you like to check it out.
